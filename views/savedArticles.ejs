<h1>Saved Articles</h1>


<!-- the existing section displays the articles, and a new section is added to display the saved articles. 
The specific content and styling for each article section can be customized based on requirements.

Remember to pass the savedArticles data to the articles.ejs template when rendering it in the route that displays 
the articles and saved articles together.
